### **Docker registries**

A Docker *registry* stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use, and Docker is configured to look for images on Docker Hub by default. You can even run your own private registry.

When you use the `docker pull` or `docker run` commands, the required images are pulled from your configured registry. When you use the `docker push` command, your image is pushed to your configured registry.

### **Images**

An *image* is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Often, an image is *based on* another image, with some additional customization. For example, you may build an image which is based on the `ubuntu` image, but installs the Apache web server and your application, as well as the configuration details needed to make your application run.

You might create your own images or you might only use those created by others and published in a registry. To build your own image, you create a *Dockerfile* with a simple syntax for defining the steps needed to create the image and run it. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the image. When you change the Dockerfile and rebuild the image, only those layers which have changed are rebuilt. This is part of what makes images so lightweight, small, and fast, when compared to other virtualization technologies.
